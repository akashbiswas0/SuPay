## ðŸš¨ Problems We're Solving

The current digital payment ecosystem, especially for social or group-based expenses, suffers from multiple challenges:

1. **Group Payments Are a Headache**  
   Coordinating payments for group activitiesâ€”like dinners, gifts, or tripsâ€”is messy and slow. You need multiple apps to chat, track, and collect money.

2. **Sending Money Abroad Costs Too Much**  
   Cross-border transfers are often expensive, complicated, and slow.

3. **Digital Money Feels Complicated**  
   For many users, crypto is intimidating. There's no straightforward use case tied to their everyday social and financial needs.

4. **Apps Don't Do It All**  
   Existing apps may help you calculate who owes what, but they donâ€™t let you settle up in the same place.
